                is help enough. However, spreading the message of mental health awareness is an even better thing to do. This spreading doesn't have to
                be preachy at all, but can come up in normal conversation. If you notice signs that someone's mental health is draining, ask if they're okay. The signs
                can be hard to notice but can be all the difference. Sometimes even knowing that someone is there for you is a gift in and of itself. Notice before
                its potentially too late, because hindsight cannot bring a person back.</p>

                <p class="fs-4 lh-1">The signs of potential distress can be very subtle, but being wrong is a lot better than being right. If you notice someone 
                isn't sleeping properly all of a sudden, their mood is extremely fickle and changes on a whim, if their usual productivity lowers but a large
                amount, be sure to check in. Even a daily check in on someone, your friend, your child, etc. These check ins show them potentially that someone
                is there for them, and that they're not alone.</p>
