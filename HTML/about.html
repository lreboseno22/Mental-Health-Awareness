<h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>Most parents are not educated on the topic of Mental Health as a result they don’t know how to handle a child that’s dealing with a mental illness or is in the stage of developing one. We believe that there should be more resources out there for parents to use that have information on the topic of mental health so that they could better help and support their children if the child is developing or experiencing a worsening of an existing mental illness. We want to raise mental health awareness not only to parents but to everyone because mental health is essential and that those living with mental health issues are deserving of care, understanding, compassion, and pathways to hope, healing, recovery, and fulfillment. Raising mental health awareness can help people to understand their symptoms, find professional treatment, and, perhaps most importantly, break the mental health stigma that leaves so many people suffering in secret.</p>
<h2>Why it's important</h2>
<p>Mental health is such a huge part of our lives as it affects how we think, feel, and act as we cope with life. It determines how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices throughout our lives. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. That's why it’s very significant for parents who are planning to have a child to be educated on this topic. They don’t recognize the signs of a mental illness from early on that the child must fend for themselves in their later years because their parents failed to give the support they were supposed to give to their child. We want parents to be more understanding and take the time to learn to identify when their child needs help and be able to support them in the best way possible. Showing individuals respect and acceptance removes a significant barrier to successfully coping with their illness</p>
