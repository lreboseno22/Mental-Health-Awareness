<h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>Most parents are not educated on the topic of Mental Health as a result they don’t know how to handle a child that’s dealing with a mental illness or is in the stage of developing one. We believe that there should be more resources out there for parents to use that have information on the topic of mental health so that they could better help and support their children if the child is developing or experiencing a worsening of an existing mental illness.</p>
<h2>Why it's important</h2>
<p>Mental health is such a huge part of our lives as it affects how we think, feel, and act as we cope with life. It determines how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices throughout our lives. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. That's why it’s very significant for parents who are planning to have a child to be educated on this topic. They don’t recognize the signs of a mental illness from early on that the child must fend for themselves in their later years because their parents failed to give the support they were supposed to give to their child.</p>
